def apply_transform(points: torch.Tensor, transform: torch.Tensor, normals: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):
    r"""Rigid transform to points and normals (optional).

    Given a point cloud P(3, N), normals V(3, N) and a transform matrix T in the form of
      | R t |
      | 0 1 |,
    the output point cloud Q = RP + t, V' = RV.

    In the implementation, P and V are (N, 3), so R should be transposed: Q = PR^T + t, V' = VR^T.

    There are two cases supported:
    1. points and normals are (*, 3), transform is (4, 4), the output points are (*, 3).
       In this case, the transform is applied to all points.
    2. points and normals are (B, N, 3), transform is (B, 4, 4), the output points are (B, N, 3).
       In this case, the transform is applied batch-wise. The points can be broadcast if B=1.

    Args:
        points (Tensor): (*, 3) or (B, N, 3)
        normals (optional[Tensor]=None): same shape as points.
        transform (Tensor): (4, 4) or (B, 4, 4)

    Returns:
        points (Tensor): same shape as points.
        normals (Tensor): same shape as points.
